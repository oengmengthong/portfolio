                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Upon the initiation of the project, I will conduct a detailed review of your requirements. After
                    this review, I will provide a project estimate. You, the client, must confirm whether to proceed
                    with the work within 7 days. Failure to confirm within the 7-day period may result in the
                    cancellation of the project without further notice.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The pricing for services is based on the selected plan: Silver, Gold, or Diamond. Payment terms will
                    be defined at the start of the project, with a percentage of the total project fee to be paid
                    upfront. The remaining payment must be made upon project completion and client approval.

                    Revisions and changes to the project are allowed as per the terms of the selected pricing plan. For
                    Silver plans, no changes are allowed once the requirements are confirmed. For Gold and Diamond
                    plans, limited changes are included, and additional requests will be charged based on the pricing
                    plan.
